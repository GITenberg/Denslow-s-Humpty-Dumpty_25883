<img src = "images/decH.png" width = "40" height = "27"
alt = "H" title = "H"></span>UMPTY-DUMPTY was a smooth, round little
chap, with a winning smile, and a great golden heart in his broad
breast.</p>

<p>Only one thing troubled Humpty, and that was, that he might fall and
crack his thin, white skin; he wished to be hard, all the way through,
for he felt his heart wabble when he walked, or ran about, so off he
went to the Black Hen for advice.</p>

<p>This Hen was kind and wise, so she was just the one, for him to go to
with his trouble.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your father, Old Humpty,&rdquo; said the Hen, &ldquo;was very
foolish, and would take warning from no one; you know what the poet said
of him:</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>&lsquo;Humpty-Dumpty sat on a wall,</p>
<p>Humpty-Dumpty had a great fall;</p>
<p>All the king&rsquo;s horses, and all the king&rsquo;s men</p>
<p>Cannot put Humpty-Dumpty together again.&rsquo;</p>
</div>

<div class = "background left" style = "background-image:
url(images/pic02.png); min-height: 274px;">

<p class = "empty left" style = "width: 230px; height:
124px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class = "empty left" style = "width: 290px; height:
150px;">&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you see, he came to a very bad end, just because he was
reckless, and would not take a hint from any one, he was much worse than
a scrambled egg; the king, his horses and his men, did all they could
for him, but his case was hopeless,&rdquo; and the Hen shook her
head&nbsp;sadly.</p>
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class = "illustration">
<img src = "images/pic03.png" width = "467" height = "398"
alt = "Humpty's father after his fall">
</p>

<p>&ldquo;What you must do,&rdquo; continued the Hen, as she wiped a
tear from her bright blue eye, &ldquo;is to go to the Farmer&rsquo;s
Wife, next door, and tell her to put you into a pot of boiling hot
water; your skin is so hard and smooth, it will not hurt you, and when
you come out, you may do as you wish, nothing can break you, you can
tumble about to your heart&rsquo;s content, and you will not break, nor
even dent yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Humpty rolled in next door, and told the Farmer&rsquo;s Wife that
he wanted to be put into boiling hot water as he was too brittle to be
of any use to himself or to any one else.</p>

<p class = "illustration">
<img src = "images/pic04.png" width = "402" height = "250"
alt = "Humpty talks to the farmer's wife">
</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed you shall,&rdquo; said the Farmer&rsquo;s Wife,
&ldquo;what is more I shall wrap you up in a piece of spotted calico, so
that you will have a nice colored dress; you will come out, looking as
bright as an Easter Egg.&rdquo;</p>

<p class = "floatright offset">
<img src = "images/pic05.png" width = "243" height = "654"
alt = "Humpty in his calico bundle goes into the pot">
</p>

<p>So she tied him up in a gay new rag, and dropped him into the copper
kettle of boiling water that was on the hearth.</p>

<p>It was pretty hot for Humpty at first, but he soon got used to it,
and was happy, for he felt himself getting harder every minute.</p>

<p>He did not have to stay in the water long, before he was quite well
done, and as hard as a brick all the way through; so, untying the rag,
he jumped out of the kettle as tough and as bright as any hard boiled
Egg.</p>

<p class = "illustration">
<img src = "images/pic06.png" width = "355" height = "462"
alt = "Decorated Humpty emerges from the pot">
</p>

<p class = "floatright">
<img src = "images/pic07a.png" width = "212" height = "267"
alt = "Humpty jumps from the mantel">
</p>

<p>The calico had marked him from head to foot with big, bright, red
spots, he was as gaudy as a circus clown, and as nimble and merry as
one.</p>

<div class = "background right bottom" style = "background-image:
url(images/pic07b.png); padding-right: 18px;">

<p>The Farmer&rsquo;s Wife shook with laughter to see the pranks of the
little fellow, for he frolicked and frisked about from table to chair,
and mantelpiece; he would fall from the shelf to the floor, just to show
how hard he was; and after thanking the good woman most politely, for
the service she had done him, he walked out into the sunshine, on the
clothes-line, like a rope dancer, to see the wide, wide world.</p>

<p>Of&nbsp;the travels of Humpty-Dumpty much could be said; he went
East, West, North and South; he sailed the seas, he walked and rode on
the land through all the Countries of the Earth, and all his life long
he was happy and content.</p>

<p class = "illustration">
<img src = "images/pic10.jpg" width = "392" height = "525"
alt = "Full Page: Humpty rides a mouse jumping a hurdle">
</p>

<p>Sometimes as a clown, in a circus, he would make fun for old and
young; again, as a wandering minstrel,</p>

<p class = "illustration">
<img src = "images/pic11.png" width = "512" height = "520"
alt = "Old man with ear trumpet listens to Humpty singing">
</p>

<p>he twanged the strings of his banjo and sung a merry song, and so on
through all his travels, he would lighten the cares of others, and make
them forget their sorrows, and fill every heart with joy.</p>

<p class = "illustration">
<img src = "images/pic12.png" width = "437" height = "283"
alt = "Humpty greets little girl with doll">
</p>

<p>But wherever he went, in sunshine or in rain, he never forgot to sing
the praises of the wise Black Hen nor the good, kind Farmer&rsquo;s
Wife, who had started him in life, <i>hardened</i> against sorrow, with
a big heart in the right place, for the cheer and comfort of OTHERS.</p>

corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
